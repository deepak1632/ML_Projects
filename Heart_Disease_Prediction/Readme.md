# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction Project

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health parameters.  
It applies multiple **Machine Learning algorithms** and compares their performance.  
The project also includes a **Streamlit web app** for user interaction, where users can input health details and get predictions in real time.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze patient health data for heart disease risk factors.
- Build and evaluate ML models for classification.
- Compare algorithms based on performance metrics.
- Deploy a **Streamlit-based user-friendly application**.
- Save trained models using **Pickle** for reusability.
