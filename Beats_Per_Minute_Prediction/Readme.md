ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

The BPM Prediction App is a machine learning project that predicts the Beats Per Minute (BPM) of songs based on their audio features. Built with Python and Streamlit, the app allows both single-song predictions and batch predictions from CSV files. Users can choose from multiple models, including XGBoost, LightGBM, Gradient Boosting, or an Ensemble of all models for more accurate results.

**This project was inspired by the Kaggle Playground Series â€“ Season 5, Episode 9 challenge on predicting the BPM of songs using synthetic tabular data.**
